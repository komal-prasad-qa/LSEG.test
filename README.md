# Stock Outlier Detection Application

This document explains how to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Version**: `23.0.1`
- **Selenium Version**: `4.26.0`
- **Apache Commons CSV Version**: `1.12.0`
- **Chrome Version**: `131` (with the respective ChromeDriver version)

## Project Setup

1. **Project Type**: Maven Project created in Eclipse.
2. **Dependencies**: All dependencies are specified in the `pom.xml` file in the repository.

## File Locations

- **Main Java File**:  
  Located at: `StockOutlier/src/main/java/Stock.java`
  
- **Sample Data Files**:  
  These are specified in the code and should be available on your local system.

## Running the Application

1. Ensure all prerequisites are installed and properly set up.
2. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred IDE.
3. Run the Java file `Stock.java`:
   - This file identifies outliers based on random row selection.
   - Note: The code may need to be run multiple times as a random row is selected each time.
   - On successful execution, an outliers file will be generated.

## Output

- **Outliers File**:  
  - The outliers file is created in the same project folder.
  - It will be visible in the Eclipse Project Explorer view.

- **Sample Output Files**:  
  - Examples of outliers files generated by the application:
    - `FLTR LSE_outliers.csv`
    - `TSLA_outliers.csv`

## Notes

- If outliers are not detected on the first run, re-run the code until an outliers file is generated.
